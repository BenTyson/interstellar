## 2. Full Vision

### What is FarmCalc?

FarmCalc is a network of practical calculators for farmers, ranchers, homesteaders, and rural landowners. Every calculator solves a real problem that farmers face daily.

**Examples:**
- Seed rate calculator (lbs per acre by crop)
- Fertilizer calculator (NPK by soil test)
- Cattle weight estimator (by measurements)
- Fence post spacing calculator
- Hay storage calculator
- Pond volume calculator
- Tractor PTO speed calculator

### Why This Will Work

1. **Massively underserved** - Farmers use ugly government PDFs or mental math
2. **High search volume** - "fertilizer calculator", "cattle weight calculator" = thousands monthly
3. **Premium ad rates** - Agriculture CPMs are $15-30 (equipment advertisers pay well)
4. **No good competition** - University extension sites are clunky, hard to use on mobile
5. **Practical audience** - Farmers want tools that work, not fluff
6. **Truly passive** - Formulas don't change, crops don't change

### Target Users

| Persona | Example Need | Behavior |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Row Crop Farmer** | Seed rate, fertilizer, yield estimate | Searches on phone in field |
| **Cattle Rancher** | Weight estimator, feed conversion, gestation | Practical, no-nonsense |
| **Homesteader** | Chicken feed, garden spacing, canning | DIY, cost-conscious |
| **Hobby Farmer** | Fence calculator, pond volume | Weekend projects |
| **Rural Landowner** | Acreage, timber estimate, well depth | Property management |

### Differentiators

| FarmCalc | Extension/Gov Sites |
|----------|---------------------|
| Mobile-first, fast | Desktop-only, slow |
| Clean, modern UI | 1990s design |
| One calculator per page | Buried in PDFs |
| Works offline | Requires connection |
| No login required | Often behind portals |

### Calculator Component Pattern

```typescript
// Each calculator is a standalone Astro component with client-side JS

interface CalculatorInput {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  type: 'number' | 'select' | 'radio';
  unit?: string;
  options?: { value: string; label: string }[];
  defaultValue?: number | string;
  min?: number;
  max?: number;
  step?: number;
}

interface CalculatorResult {
  label: string;
  value: number | string;
  unit: string;
  explanation?: string;
}

interface Calculator {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  inputs: CalculatorInput[];
  calculate: (inputs: Record<string, number | string>) => CalculatorResult[];
  formula?: string;           // Show the math
  assumptions?: string[];     // What we assume
  tips?: string[];           // Practical advice
}
```

### Sample Calculator: Cattle Weight Estimator

```typescript
const cattleWeightCalculator: Calculator = {
  slug: 'cattle-weight-calculator',
  title: 'Cattle Weight Calculator',
  description: 'Estimate cattle weight from heart girth and body length measurements',
  category: 'livestock',
  inputs: [
    {
      id: 'heartGirth',
      label: 'Heart Girth',
      type: 'number',
      unit: 'inches',
      min: 30,
      max: 120,
    },
    {
      id: 'bodyLength',
      label: 'Body Length',
      type: 'number',
      unit: 'inches',
      min: 20,
      max: 100,
    },
    {
      id: 'animalType',
      label: 'Animal Type',
      type: 'select',
      options: [
        { value: 'beef', label: 'Beef Cattle' },
        { value: 'dairy', label: 'Dairy Cattle' },
      ],
    },
  ],
  calculate: (inputs) => {
    const { heartGirth, bodyLength, animalType } = inputs;
    const hg = Number(heartGirth);
    const bl = Number(bodyLength);

    // Schaeffer formula: (Heart Girth² × Body Length) / 300
    // Adjusted for beef vs dairy
    const divisor = animalType === 'beef' ? 300 : 330;
    const weight = (hg * hg * bl) / divisor;

    return [
      {
        label: 'Estimated Weight',
        value: Math.round(weight),
        unit: 'lbs',
        explanation: 'Based on the Schaeffer formula. Accuracy ±3-5%.',
      },
    ];
  },
  formula: 'Weight = (Heart Girth² × Body Length) ÷ 300',
  assumptions: [
    'Animal is in average body condition',
    'Measurements taken correctly (see guide below)',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Measure heart girth just behind the front legs',
    'Measure body length from point of shoulder to pin bone',
    'For more accuracy, weigh a few animals to calibrate',
  ],
};
```

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low initial traffic | High | Medium | Expected; SEO takes time |
| Formula errors | Medium | High | Validate against extension sources |
| Niche too small | Low | Medium | Agriculture is huge market |
| Extension sites improve | Low | Low | They're slow to change |

---

## 13. AI Agent Instructions

### Do
- Validate formulas against university extension sources
- Include practical tips farmers actually use
- Show the math (formula transparency builds trust)
- Make inputs forgiving (handle edge cases)
- Optimize for mobile (farmers use phones in field)

### Don't
- Invent formulas - use established agricultural science
- Over-complicate UI - farmers want fast answers
- Forget units - always show and convert units
- Ignore regional differences (mention when formulas vary)

### Formula Sources
- University Extension services (Purdue, Iowa State, Texas A&M)
- USDA publications
- Established agricultural references

### Decisions Already Made
- Astro over Next.js (static, fast)
- Client-side calculations (no server needed)
- One calculator per page (SEO + focused)
- Show formulas (transparency)
- Cloudflare Pages (free, fast)
