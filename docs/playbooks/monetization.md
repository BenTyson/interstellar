## Display Advertising

### Overview

**Model**: Get paid per 1000 impressions (CPM/RPM)
**Passivity**: 10/10 - Truly set and forget

| 50K sessions/mo | **Mediavine** | 50K sessions | $15-30 |
| 100K+ pageviews | **AdThrive** | 100K pageviews | $20-35 |

```
Monthly Revenue = (Monthly Pageviews / 1000) × RPM

  50,000 pageviews × $20 RPM = $1,000/month
```

### Best Practices

1. **Placement matters**: Above fold, within content, sidebar
2. **Don't overdo it**: 3-4 ad units max, user experience first
3. **Niches affect RPM**: Finance > Tech > Lifestyle > Entertainment
4. **Mobile optimization**: Most traffic is mobile, optimize layouts
5. **Graduate quickly**: Move to Mediavine ASAP (4-5x revenue)
