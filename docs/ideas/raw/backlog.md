## Explored but Not Selected

### Generator/Placeholder Tools
- Lorem ipsum generator (with variants: hipster, corporate, pirate)
- Fake data generator (names, emails, addresses, credit cards)
- Gradient generator
- SVG pattern backgrounds
- Favicon generator
- Open Graph image generator
- Placeholder image service

**Notes**: Could be absorbed into Clutch or built standalone. Lower ceiling but very passive.

---

### Cheatsheet Sites
- Git commands cheatsheet
- Regex cheatsheet with live tester
- Keyboard shortcuts (VS Code, Figma, etc.)
- HTTP status codes reference
- Markdown syntax guide
- Cron expression builder
- CSS flexbox/grid reference

**Notes**: Pure SEO play, very low maintenance, but takes time to rank. Could be a section within Clutch.

---

### Comparison Pages ("X vs Y")
- "React vs Vue vs Svelte"
- "Vercel vs Netlify vs Cloudflare"
- "Notion vs Obsidian vs Roam"
- "Stripe vs PayPal vs Square"
- "Tailwind vs Bootstrap"

**Notes**: High commercial intent, good affiliate potential. Needs occasional updates (7/10 passivity). Programmatic SEO opportunity.

## Raw Captures (From Original Research)

### Prompt Workflow Library
- Not just prompts, but "prompt chains" - curated multi-step workflows
- "Get a week of LinkedIn content in 5 prompts" type products
- Digital product sales (bundles $19-49)
- Subscription for monthly new workflows ($9/month)

**Notes**: Lower passivity - content needs updates as AI models change.

---

### AI Agent Reviews ("Vibe Check")
- TrustPilot/G2 for AI agents
- User-generated reviews
- Sponsored/featured listings
- Lead gen to enterprise buyers

**Notes**: First-mover advantage in emerging category, but requires moderation (lower passivity).

---

### Public Data API
- Aggregate government/public data into usable format
- Business registrations, permits, health inspections, nonprofit 990s
- API access (usage-based pricing)
- Bulk data exports

**Notes**: Defensible if data is unique. Requires data pipeline maintenance.
