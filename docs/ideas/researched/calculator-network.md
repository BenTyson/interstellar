## Why This Concept

- Zero customer support burden

### Revenue Model

### Passivity Score: 10/10
- No accounts, no subscriptions, no support

## Research Findings

### Successful Examples
- Calculator.net - Massive calculator network
- Omni Calculator - Raised funding, 400+ calculators
- NerdWallet calculators - Lead gen to financial products

### Traffic Potential
- Long-tail keywords: 500-5000 searches/month each
- 20 calculators × 2,000 avg searches = 40K potential monthly reach
- 50 calculators at scale = 100K+ potential

### Monetization Math
```
50K pageviews × $15 RPM (Mediavine) = $750/month
100K pageviews × $20 RPM = $2,000/month
200K pageviews × $25 RPM = $5,000/month
```
