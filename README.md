# Interstellar - Passive Income HQ

Central command for ideation, research, and planning of passive income web projects.

## What is This Repo?

This is **not** a project repo - it's a **meta-repo** for managing multiple passive income projects:

- Brainstorming and researching new ideas
- Creating detailed session-start documents for new Claude sessions
- Tracking status across all projects
- Storing reusable playbooks and templates

Each actual project lives in its own repo with a comprehensive context document.

## Session-Start Documents

The `/docs/session-start/` folder contains comprehensive context documents designed for new Claude sessions. Each document includes:

1. **Quick Context** - One-glance project summary
2. **Full Vision** - What, why, who, differentiators
3. **Technical Architecture** - Stack, data models, infrastructure
4. **Implementation Plan** - Phased deliverables with current status
5. **Critical Files** - Key files and entry points
6. **AI Agent Context** - Instructions, decisions made, pitfalls
7. **Session Log** - History of work across sessions

**Goal**: A new Claude session can read one document and start productive work immediately.

## Philosophy

### Passive Income Criteria

Projects in this portfolio must meet:

1. **Truly Passive** - Minimal ongoing intervention
2. **Low Maintenance** - No customer support burden
3. **Scalable Revenue** - Not tied to hours worked
4. **Clear Monetization** - Obvious revenue path
5. **Technical Simplicity** - One-person maintainable

### Build Order

1. Start with most passive option (Calcverse)
2. Get to MVP before starting next project
3. Let winners compound, cut losers
4. Reinvest revenue into scaling
